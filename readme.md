#Memory Game

##How to Play
1. Click on a square to see its picture.
2. Click on another square to find a matching picture.
3. If the pictures match, the pictures will disappear.
4. If the pictures do not match, the pictures will flip over and you can try again to find another two matching pair.
5. At the end, you will be given the number of total clicks it took you to finish the game.

##User Stories

##Pseudocode Plans

* Attach a hidden picture to each cell.  

* Add a click event to each cell so that it shows the picture when it is clicked on.

###Day 2
* If two pictures match, the pictures are hidden again.

* Remove click capability from cells that already had matched pictures.

###Day 3
* If the two pictures do not match, the cards should be hidden again.

* The player should not be able to click on these cells again.

* Once there are no cards left, the player should receive a message that the game is over.

###Day 4  
* A counter shown on the page should let the player know how many clicks it took him/her to win the game.     

* Final styling, any other features

##Other To Do Items

###Day 5
* Run code through HTML and CSS through validators

* Figure out Github pages and how to host, push page, etc.
