## Project Workflow
Meets/Exceeds Expectations. I really enjoyed reading your readme, very detailed. I really like how you mapped out your schedule with feature implementations. How close were you able to meet your scheduling? Include some wireframes next time around as well.

## Technical Requirements
Meets expectations. Your code is a clear indication of a good understanding of the the learning objectives from Unit 1. There are a couple of bugs: click counter not resetting on reset game. As well as a minor bug about resetting the game bugging out the image. IE: click an image, hit reset button, and it throws an off by one error. Overall really solid implementation though.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. Code looks properly indented. No comments! Trust me ly, future you will be much happier with past you the more you comment on code. Other than that, looks great, add comments!

## Problem Solving
Meets Expectations.  Was very clear you knew how to tackle this program as per your readme. You had a really clear plan of attack and executed really well!

## Overall
Super happy with the results of your project, let me know if you have any questions/concerns.
